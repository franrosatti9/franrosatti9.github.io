            A platformer game where players are guided by the sounds of a mystical music box from ancient stories. 
            <br/> This game was part of the MPVP (My First Professional Videogame) a learning program by <a href="https://adva.vg/en/about-us/"><b>ADVA.</b></a> 
            <br/> I joined the project during its later stages of development, but I gained valuable experience working with a diverse team, 
            full of different roles, strengths, and talents. I also had the opportunity to <b>deepen my understanding of some of Unity's concepts and features</b>.
            <br/>
            <br/> I contributed mainly in UI development, localization and character feel, as well as general improvements and bug fixing.
